Send personalized emails based on Gmail template to multiple recipients using Gmail and Google Sheets. The namesake **Group Merge** feature allows the sender to group the contents of two or more rows into one email for a single recipient.

Similar to [the mail merge feature available in Microsoft Word](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-mail-merge-for-bulk-email-letters-labels-and-envelopes-f488ed5b-b849-4c11-9cff-932c49474705), **Group Merge** allows Gmail/Google Workspace users to send personalized emails to the recipients listed in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Some notable features are:  
- **Group Merge** feature combines contents of two or more entries for the same recipient into a single email.
- Use Gmail drafts as template for mail merge. **HTML styling**, **file attachments**, **CC & BCC recipients**, and **Gmail labels** are preserved in the personalized emails.
